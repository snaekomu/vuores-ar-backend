#REFERENCE FILES DIRECTORY

This directory contains files from legacy versions of the client as documentation to ensure backwards compatibility should the API change.
Older versions should still be available on github if this directory is deleted but it's preferable to keep here for ease of access.
DO NOT DELETE
